# Upstreaming dashboard

The eventual goal of the LeanCamCombi project is to not contain any significant new formalisation, but instead to act as a shallow layer over [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) showing concretely how to turn paper-combinatorics into Lean-combinatorics.

As such, it is crucial to continuously organise upstreaming from LeanCamCombi to Mathlib.
The way we organise this is with the following two lists,
showing files with no LeanCamCombi dependencies depending on whether they contain `sorry` or not.
